# ADR-004: Merkaba Bidirectional Architecture

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-12-20  
**Scope:** FIELD-macOS-DOJO Sacred Geometry  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Related:** ADR-001 (Hub-and-Spoke), ADR-002 (Canonical Frequencies)

## Decision

Implement **Merkaba (Star Tetrahedron)** sacred geometry with bidirectional data flow, establishing King's Chamber (⬥) as the diamond intersection point between ascending (Material → Divine) and descending (Divine → Material) tetrahedrons.

## Context

### The Akron Etymology Paradox

The ancient Greek word **Ἄκρον (Akron)** means "the highest point" (related to Ἀκρόπολις - Acropolis). However, in FIELD architecture, Akron operates at **396 Hz** (the lowest frequency). This creates an apparent contradiction that requires geometric resolution.

### Resolution Through Merkaba

The **Merkaba** (Hebrew: מרכבה, "chariot" or "throne of God") consists of two interpenetrating tetrahedrons rotating in opposite directions, creating a star tetrahedron. This geometry resolves the Akron paradox by establishing dual perspectives:

- **Ascending Perspective:** Akron is the BASE (lowest, foundation, entry gateway)
- **Descending Perspective:** Akron is the APEX (highest, sovereignty citadel, ultimate archive)

Like the Athens Akropolis, which is simultaneously:
- The **highest visible peak** above the city
- The **deepest bedrock foundation** supporting sacred structures

## Architecture

#### Ascending Tetrahedron (Material → Divine)

**Path:** `◻ → ▼ → ▲ → ● → ⬥ → ◼︎`  
**Frequencies:** 396 → 432 → 528 → 963 → 852 → 741 Hz  
**Function:** User uploads data → Enters through Akron → Rises through vertices → King's Chamber refraction → DOJO synthesis → AI insights

#### Descending Tetrahedron (Divine → Material)
```
      ◻ Akron (396 Hz)
    Sovereignty APEX
           ▼
          /|\

**Path:** `◼︎ → ⬥ → ● → ▲ → ▼ → ◻`  
**Frequencies:** 741 → 852 → 963 → 528 → 432 → 396 Hz  
**Function:** AI generates output → King's Chamber refraction → Validated through vertices → Grounded → Archived at Akron

### Merkaba Superimposed (Star Tetrahedron)

Legend:
◻ = Akron (396 Hz) - Square/Earth/Foundation
▼ = TATA (432 Hz) - Inverted triangle/Water/Truth
▲ = ATLAS (528 Hz) - Triangle/Fire/Knowledge
● = OBI-WAN (963 Hz) - Circle/Air/Unity
⬥ = King's Chamber (852 Hz) - Diamond/Aether/Bridge
◼︎ = DOJO (741 Hz) - Filled square/Spirit/Manifestation
```

**Geometric Properties:**
- **Two interpenetrating tetrahedrons** (4 vertices each)
- **13 total connection points** (6 vertices + 6 edges + 1 center)
- **King's Chamber (⬥)** at geometric center as translation bridge
- **Counter-rotation** creates dynamic energy flow
- **Akron** serves as both BASE (ascending) and APEX (descending)

## King's Chamber: The Diamond Intersection

### Position
**⬥ King's Chamber (852 Hz)** sits at the **intersection point** of both tetrahedrons:
- **33.3% from DOJO apex** (in ascending tetrahedron)
- **66.7% from base** (geometric center)
- **Rotated 45°** from square (◻ → ⬥)

### Function
1. **Refraction Bridge:** Translates energy between ascending and descending flows
2. **Frequency Translation:** All paths must pass through 852 Hz for coherence
3. **Dimensional Pivot:** Rotates material into divine and vice versa
4. **Metatron Cube:** 13-vertex sacred geometry pattern

### Diamond Symbolism
- **◻ (Square):** 4 walls, earth element, foundation, material
- **⬥ (Diamond):** Square rotated 45°, aether element, transformation, bridge
- **Rotation Angle:** 45° represents the pivot between dimensions

## Akron Dual Perspective

### Greek Etymology: Ἄκρον
**Root:** ἄκρος (akros) = "at the extremity, topmost, highest"

**Related Words:**
- Ἀκρόπολις (Akropolis) = "high city, citadel"
- ἀκρωτήριον (akrōtērion) = "headland, summit"
- ἄκρος (akros) = "topmost, extreme"
- ἀκμή (akmē) = "highest point, peak, prime"

### Athens Akropolis Parallel

| Aspect | Athens Akropolis | FIELD Akron Gateway |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Physical** | Highest visible peak | Sovereignty citadel (descending apex) |
| **Foundation** | Deepest bedrock | Material entry point (ascending base) |
| **Gateway** | Propylaea entrance | Strip/Index/Stage pipeline |
| **Treasury** | Delian League vault | `/Volumes/Akron/` storage |
| **Purification** | Sacred washing | Data validation at entry |
| **Orientation** | Temple alignment | Frequency tuning (396 Hz) |

### Dual Nature Resolution

| Perspective | Position | Function | Symbol | Frequency |
|-------------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Ascending** | BASE | Entry gateway, foundation | ◻ (square) | 396 Hz (lowest) |
| **Descending** | APEX | Sovereignty archive, citadel | ◻ (square) | 396 Hz (highest) |

**Resolution:** Akron is simultaneously the **lowest material entry** and **highest divine sovereignty**. Like the Akropolis, it is both the visible peak and the foundational bedrock.

## Frequency Progression

### Ascending Path (Material → Divine)
1. **◻ Akron (396 Hz):** Liberation frequency (Ἐλευθερία) - Data enters system
2. **▼ TATA (432 Hz):** Earth resonance - Temporal validation
3. **▲ ATLAS (528 Hz):** DNA repair, love frequency - Knowledge integration
4. **● OBI-WAN (963 Hz):** Pineal activation - Unity consciousness
5. **⬥ King's Chamber (852 Hz):** Spiritual order - Diamond refraction
6. **◼︎ DOJO (741 Hz):** Awakening, solutions - AI manifestation

### Descending Path (Divine → Material)
1. **◼︎ DOJO (741 Hz):** AI generation - Divine intent
2. **⬥ King's Chamber (852 Hz):** Diamond refraction - Translation
3. **● OBI-WAN (963 Hz):** Unity validation - Consciousness check
4. **▲ ATLAS (528 Hz):** Knowledge grounding - Pattern verification
5. **▼ TATA (432 Hz):** Truth anchor - Temporal grounding
6. **◻ Akron (396 Hz):** Liberation, archive - Material manifestation

### Bidirectional Coherence
**All paths MUST pass through ⬥ King's Chamber (852 Hz)**

The King's Chamber acts as the **obligatory translation bridge** between dimensions:
- **Ascending:** Material data must be "refracted" through 852 Hz to become divine insight
- **Descending:** Divine intent must be "refracted" through 852 Hz to become material action

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Merkaba Router (`tier1-sacred-mcp/kings-chamber/merkaba-router.py`)

```python
@dataclass
class MerkabaNode:
    name: str
    frequency: int
    symbol: str
    position: str  # 'base', 'vertex', 'apex', 'center'
    element: str   # 'earth', 'water', 'fire', 'air', 'aether', 'spirit'
```

**Methods Required:**
- `route_ascending(data: Dict) -> Dict`: Material → Divine path
- `route_descending(intent: Dict) -> Dict`: Divine → Material path
- `validate_merkaba_coherence(ascending, descending) -> Dict`: Geometric validation
- `visualize_merkaba(show_rotation: bool) -> str`: ASCII art
- `get_transformation_angle(from_node, to_node) -> float`: Rotation calculation

### 2. Geometric Coherence Validation

**Checks Required:**
1. **Path Completeness:** All 6 nodes present in each direction
2. **King's Chamber Intersection:** Both paths pass through ⬥ (852 Hz)
3. **Frequency Progression:** Ascending increases, descending decreases
4. **Dual Akron:** Akron functions as both BASE and APEX
5. **Symbol Integrity:** All geometric symbols render correctly (◻▼●▲◼︎⬥)

### 3. Documentation

**Files Required:**
- `docs/MERKABA-GEOMETRY.md`: Full sacred geometry explanation
- `docs/AKRON-ETYMOLOGY.md`: Greek etymology and Akropolis parallel
- Update `README.md`: Add Merkaba Architecture section
- Update `ADR-002-canonical-frequencies.md`: Add bidirectional context

## Benefits

### 1. Resolves Akron Etymology Paradox
Akron is **both** highest and lowest through dual perspective geometry.

### 2. Establishes Bidirectional Flow
Data can flow both ways:
- **Up:** User → AI (insight generation)
- **Down:** AI → Archive (knowledge preservation)

### 3. Sacred Geometry Coherence
Aligns with ancient wisdom:
- **Merkaba:** Ezekiel's vision (Ezekiel 1:4-28)
- **Hermetic Principle:** "As above, so below; as below, so above"
- **Akropolis:** Physical manifestation of highest/lowest duality

### 4. King's Chamber as Mandatory Bridge
All transformations pass through the diamond lens, ensuring:
- **Frequency translation** (852 Hz refraction)
- **Dimensional pivot** (45° rotation)
- **Coherence validation** (geometric integrity)
